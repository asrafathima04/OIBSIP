# OIBSIP - Python Internship
### Task-1 : Voice Assistant

This is my first task for the Oasis Infobyte Python internship. 
I made a simple voice assistant using Python that can:
- Reply when I say hello  
- Tell the current time and date  
- Search things on Google  

It’s a beginner level project and I really enjoyed making it :)

### Task-2 : BMI Calculator

This is my second task for the Oasis Infobyte Python internship.  
I created a simple BMI calculator that takes the user's weight and height,  
calculates the BMI, and shows whether the person is underweight,  
normal, overweight, or obese.

It’s a beginner level project and helped me understand user input and conditions better :)
