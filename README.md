# OIBSIP - Python Internship
### Task-1 : Voice Assistant

This is my first task for the Oasis Infobyte Python internship. 
I made a simple voice assistant using Python that can:
- Reply when I say hello  
- Tell the current time and date

It’s a beginner level project and I really enjoyed making it :)

### Task-2 : BMI Calculator

This is my second task for the Oasis Infobyte Python internship.  
I created a simple BMI calculator that takes the user's weight and height,  
calculates the BMI, and shows whether the person is underweight,  
normal, overweight, or obese.

It’s a beginner level project and helped me understand user input and conditions better :)

### Task-3 : Random Password Generator

This is my third task for the Oasis Infobyte Python Internship.  
I created a simple random password generator using Python that lets the user:  
- Choose the password length.  
- Include letters, numbers, and symbols.  
- Get a random strong password instantly.  

It’s a beginner-friendly project and helped me learn about loops, randomization, and character handling in Python.
