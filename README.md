# OIBSIP - Python Internship
### Task-1 : Voice Assistant

This is my first task for the Oasis Infobyte Python internship. 
I made a simple voice assistant using Python that can:
- Reply when I say hello  
- Tell the current time and date  
- Search things on Google  

It’s a beginner level project and I really enjoyed making it :)
